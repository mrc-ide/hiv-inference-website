  As the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa matures, evidence about the age
    distribution of new HIV infections and how this has changed over the
    epidemic is needed to guide HIV prevention. We assessed trends in
    age-specific HIV incidence in six population-based cohort studies in eastern
    and southern Africa, reporting changes in average age at infection, age
    distribution of new infections, and birth cohort cumulative incidence.

summary: >
  HIV incidence declined in all age groups and shifted slightly, but not
    dramatically, to older ages. Disproportionate new HIV infections occur among
    15-24-year-old women and 20-29-year-old men, supporting focused prevention
    in these groups. But 40-60% of infections were outside these ages,
    emphasising the importance of providing appropriate HIV prevention to adults
    of all ages.
